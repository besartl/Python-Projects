# This is a BMI calculator written in python code.

#Get user input for weight in pounds and height in feet
weight_pounds = float(input("Enter your weight in pounds: "))
height_feet = float(input("Enter your height in feet: "))

#Convert height from feet to inches
height_inches = height_feet * 12

#Calculate BMI using the formula
BMI = (weight_pounds / (height_inches * height_inches)) * 703

#Display the calculated BMI
print("your bmi is:", BMI)

#Interpret the BMI
if BMI < 18.5:
    print("You are underweight.")
elif 18.5 <= BMI < 25:
    print("Ypu are normal weight.")
elif 25 <= BMI < 30:
    print("You are overweight/")
